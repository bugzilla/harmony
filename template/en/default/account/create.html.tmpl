%]

<p>
  To create a [% terms.Bugzilla %] account, all you need to do is to enter
    a login name of your choice and a legitimate email address.
  You will receive an email at this address to confirm the creation of your
  account. <b>You will not be able to log in until you receive the email.</b>
  If it doesn't arrive within a reasonable amount of time, you may contact
  the maintainer of this Bugzilla installation
  at <a href="mailto:[% Param("maintainer") %]">[% Param("maintainer") %]</a>.
</p>

<p>
  If you already have an account and want to change your
  [% IF Param('allowemailchange') %]
    email address or
  [% END %]
  login name, you can change it from the Preferences page after logging in.
</p>

<p>
  A user account is required to report new [% terms.bugs %] or to comment into
  existing ones, as you may be contacted for more information if needed.
  This also lets other users clearly identify who is the author of comments
  or changes made into [% terms.bugs %]. <b>Note that your email address will
  <em>never</em> be displayed to logged out users. Only registered users will be able to see it.</b>
</p>

[% IF Param('createemailregexp') == '.*' %]
<p>
  <b>PRIVACY NOTICE:</b> [% terms.Bugzilla %] is an open [% terms.bug %]
  tracking system. Activity on most [% terms.bugs %] will be visible to
  registered users.
    That includes email addresses. We <b>recommend</b> using a
    secondary account or free web email service (such as Gmail, Yahoo,
    Hotmail, or similar) to avoid receiving spam at your primary email address.
